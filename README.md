# CandleGP - Gaussian Processes in Pytorch
*Thomas Viehmann*, tv@lernapparat.de

I felt Bayesian the other day, so I ported (a tiny part of) the
excellent [GPFlow library](https://github.com/gpflow/gpflow) to
Pytorch.

I have kept the structure close to GPFlow.
Most of the great ideas are from the GPFlow team, errors are my own.
